The basic functionality is provided by the tcl_eval function, which is used to pass on Tcl commands. The Canvas widget is used to create a device for plotting of julia's graphics. In particular, among others, the Winston and Images package can render to such a device.\n\nThe example sketch.jl illustrates this widget for a different purpose.\n\nIn addition, there are convenience methods for working with most of the widgets provided by Tk similar to the ones found in R's tcltk package.  For example, we add the tcl function as a wrapper for tcl_eval which provides translations from julia objects into Tcl constructs.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Constructors","page":"Home","title":"Constructors","text":"Constructors are provided  for the following widgets\n\nToplevel: for top level windows\nFrame, Labelframe, Notebook, Panedwindow: for the basic containers\nLabel, Button, Menu: basic elements\nCheckbutton, Radio, Combobox, Slider, Spinbox: selection widgets\nEntry, Text: text widgets\nTreeview: for trees, but also listboxes and grids\nSizegrip, Separator, Progressbar, Image various widgets\n\nThe basic usage simply calls the ttk:: counterpart, though one can use named arguments to pass in configuration options.

For a single option of a widget accessed via cget and modified via configure, one can use the index notation with a symbol, as in widget[:option] or widget[:option] = value.\nFor widget layout, we have pack, pack_configure, forget, grid, grid_configure, grid_forget, ... providing interfaces to the appropriate Tk commands, but also formlayout and page_add for working with simple forms and notebooks and pane windows..\nWe add the methods get_value and set_value to get and set the primary value for a control\nWe add the methods get_items and set_items to get and set the item(s) to select from for selection widgets.\nWe add the methods width, height, get_size to get the on-screen size of a widget. For top level windows there are set_width, set_height, and set_size for adjusting the geometry. The :width and :height properties are common to most widgets, and return the requested width and height, which need not be the actual width and height on screen.\nThe conveniences get_enabled and set_enabled to specify if a widget accepts user input","category":"section"},{"location":"#Examples","page":"Home","title":"Examples","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Hello-world","page":"Home","title":"Hello world","text":"A simple \"Hello world\" example, which shows off many of the styles is given by:\n\nw = Toplevel(\"Example\")                                    ## A titled top level window\nf = Frame(w, padding = [3,3,2,2], relief=\"groove\")         ## A Frame with some options set\npack(f, expand = true, fill = \"both\")                      ## using pack to manage the layout of f\n#\nb = Button(f, \"Click for a message\")                       ## Button constructor has convenience interface\ngrid(b, 1, 1)                                              ## use grid to pack in b. 1,1 specifies location\n#\ncallback(path) = Messagebox(w, title=\"A message\", message=\"Hello World\") ## A callback to open a message\nbind(b, \"command\", callback)                            ## bind callback to 'command' option\nbind(b, \"<Return>\", callback)                           ## press return key when button has focus\n\nWe see the use of an internal frame to hold the button. The frame's layout is managed using pack, the buttons with grid. Both these have some conveniences. For grid, the location of the cell can be specified by 1-based index as shown. The button callback is just a julia function. Its first argument, path, is used internally. In this case, we open a modal dialog with the Messagebox constructor when the callback is called. The button object has this callback bound to the button's command option. This responds to a mouse click, but not a press of the enter key when the button has the focus. For that, we also bind to the <Return> event.\n\nFor the R package tctlk there are numerous examples at http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/~wettenhall/RTclTkExamples/ . We borrow a few of these to illustrate the Tk package for julia.\n\nTk commands are combined strings followed by options. Something like: .button configure -text {button text} is called as configure(button, text = \"button text). Key-value options are specified with through named arguments, which are converted to the underlying Tcl object. Similarly, path names are also translated and functions are converted to callbacks.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Pack-widgets-into-a-themed-widget-for-better-appearance","page":"Home","title":"Pack widgets into a themed widget for better appearance","text":"Toplevel is the command to create a new top-level window.
